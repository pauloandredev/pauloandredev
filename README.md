<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there</h1>
I'm Paulo AndrÃ© FÃ©lix, a passionate software developer and technology enthusiast. I currently study Computer Engineering at the State University of Minas Gerais.

<h1>ðŸš€ Experience</h1>

Passionate about creating interactive and intuitive user experiences, I've been upskilling myself in front-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns.

In my professional journey, I worked as a freelancer on some projects in the area of â€‹â€‹health and games. In addition to creating pleasant user interfaces, I took on the responsibilities of a Software Engineer, separating each step of the process and minimizing errors.

In addition to my professional activities, I took on the role of course director at the academic center and was also a class representative.

Outside of the professional environment, I have a passion for sharing my knowledge and routine with the world, in the role of "content creator" in the technological sphere.
